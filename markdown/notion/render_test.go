Since 2015, I've been teaching German online with [Authentic German Learning](https://www.authenticgermanlearning.com/) and since 2016, I am doing it as a digital nomad[^2].

[^2]: A digital nomad is someone who works online and can, therefore, live a nomadic lifestyle and does so.

Besides that, I have many other interests. Furthermore, I now feel ready to teach all the other things I learned in the last couple of years.
